# OsuDatabaseManager

### TODO:
- AutoStart feature
- Choose Player Username
- Filtering scores just like in osu! search
- Add toolbar in MainWindow
- Maybe display bg and song info when it is selected
- Show pp value for each score
- Choosable pp rework options
- Some templates (like show scores only before x date, where pp values are the same as pp rework values on x date; personal pp record history)
- Clean the code (never happening)
