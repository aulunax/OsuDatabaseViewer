# OsuDatabaseManager

### TODO:
- Add song tags, source to scoreInfo
- Add general info below scores list
- Display bg and song info when it is selected
- Show pp value for each score
- Choosable pp rework options
- Some templates (like show scores only before x date, where pp values are the same as pp rework values on x date; personal pp record history)
- Clean the code (never happening)

### Small tweeks to make:
- Date is in UTC, make it local timezone
- Better config validation maybe?
- Tweek column sizes of scores list
- Tweek sizes and behavior of all components on MainWindow

### Kinda done, but maybe some improvements?:
- Filtering scores just like in osu! search (mostly done)
